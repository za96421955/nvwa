思考：
Alright, the user is asking "北京在哪？" which means "Where is Beijing?" in English. I need to figure this out using the tools I have access to. I see that one of the tools is "baike," which is from Baidu and is a reliable source for information.

I should use the baike tool to look up the information about Beijing. I'll input the keyword "北京" into the tool. The action input should be in JSON format, so I'll set the "wd" parameter to "北京".

After getting the response from the baike tool, I'll extract the relevant information. Beijing is the capital of China, located in East Asia, and serves as the country's political, cultural, and international exchange center. It's part of the North China Plain, bordered by Tianjin to the southeast and Hebei Province to the north, west, and south.

I can use this information to answer the user clearly, stating Beijing's role as the capital, its geographical location, and its administrative significance.
